# Maze Algorithms Visualizer
Started project on January 24, 2018 and stopped working on it around early June 2018. Mostly completed, but some algorithms have yet to be implemented and some functions such as the maximizing nodes function need a lot of optimization. However, it works as intended and looks finished, and I most likely won't continue to work on this project.
